# AutoInsertTranslate

A program that automatically interacts with a website GUI to help automate a tedious procress.

I created this program for mostly personal use by me and a small group of other team memebers. It probably will not help you if you are just stumbling upon this page! Maybe you can use it to learn something about pyautogui computer vision capabilities and some other image processes in python. It also showcases some of pyautogui's interactive features like clicking, moving, and hotkeys.

This program was created to solve a problem involving lots of manual data entry into text fields on a website. The data entry task consisted of entering in a certain translation of certain phrases (see the text document) into a data field. There was a task for every language (14) in every section (many), and they were spaced out randomly in each section. 

What this program does is, after the user has clicked on the section they want to translate, it automatically detectes the language that it needs to convert to and pastes the text, then saves, and moves to the next entry in the section. This allowed us to finish this data entry task very quickly. There is also a GUI interface that lets the user easily start the program when ready, and plays a chime when the program is finished so the user knows to move to another section.
